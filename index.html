					<p>Recently, I had the chance to work with a local dry cleaners to re-designed their business website. The old site was not aesthetically pleasing to the eye, and the owners wanted to create better branding for their business.</p>
					<p> In a responsive single scrolling page, I implemented CSS3 (Flexbox) to position DOM elements and learned photo editing to recreate the business's logo. I used SEO to help search engine find and understand the content that is on the site.</p>

				<p>May.25.2017</p>
				<p>It's been a couple weeks since the big gathering at Pier 27 and here is my take away on the SIGNAL convention. I was a part of Twilio’s first Scholarship Program! Thank goodness, because I don’t think I would have been able to comfortably afford the ticket price on a college student budget. Most people were sent there by their company, to see what’s in and new with tech. What’s twilio’s next greatest API?  I even met a girl who’s in market research, her job was to chat with the developers attending this conference. and write on why the tech scene is so hot.</p>
				<p>This was my very first tech convention, and not gonna lie - it was quite overwhelming.  I felt like a little guppy in the big blue San Francisco sea. They weren’t kidding when they said there are not a lot of women in tech. Everyone I met seems to go… “Hello my name is ________, and I do, Buzzword Buzzword Buzzword. I wanted to wear a nametag that says “Hello, I’m new, please speak slowly and softly.”</p>
				<p>The second day was a lot better, there was a Twomen lunch! Basically a Twilio's women's Employee lunch event. A.k.a. A more comfortable space, to not be awkward, and talk to fellow female developers. I did enjoy this day a lot more. I didn’t feel so out of place. I remember a wise female developer once told me: “You won't always connect with everyone you talk to, but don't let that stop you.”</p>
				<p>And that is so true - Don't be afraid to talk to people. Through this Signal conference experience, after breaking out of my comfort zone, I have made connections that will last a lifetime, and I learned all kinds of things I can carry with me on my journey in technology.</p>
